# **GLOBAL SEARCH**

## Overview
_The surface web only makes up a tiny portion of the entire internet. But when you search on Google, Bing or DuckDuckgo, you still only search a tiny bit of the surface web. When searching the web you only get results in your own language. Global Search fixes this, when you put in a search term, Global Search searches every language automatically translates your search results and webpages. This means that you can tap into a trove of knowlage and the internet that used to take people years (learning new languages)._
