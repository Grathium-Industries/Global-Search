# **GLOBAL SEARCH**

## Overview
_Everyone has seen the graph of the internet, where the surface web only makes up a tiny portion of the entire internet. But when you search on Google, Bing or DuckDuckgo, you still only search a tiny bit of the surface web. This is because of languages, when searching the web you only get results in your own language. Global Search fixes this, when you put in a search term, Global Search searches every language for your search results. This means that you can tap into a trove of knowlage and the internet that used to take people years (learning new languages)._
